/**
 * A specific {@link TrackingPhase} to handle any point in which world or chunk
 * terrain generation/population is taking place. Note that while {@link State#CHUNK_LOADING}
 * is included here, it is still treated as terrain generation due to the fact that
 * a chunk load should not capture any block changes and populators may be re-ran.
 * Virtually, no capturing takes place during generation, withstanding capturing
 * entities as those can be captured safely to allow plugins final say in whether
 * the entities spawn. Likewise, Forge requires the entities to still throw
 * spawn events, so we must oblige in both Forge's requirements and Plugins requirements.
 * Note that {@link State#TERRAIN_GENERATION} and {@link State#POPULATOR_RUNNING} are
 * re-entrant and should allow for re-entrance. Re-entrance is defined in this case when
 * while a chunk is being generated/populated, the generator and/or populator require
 * a neighboring chunk to be generated/populated, which requires a re-entrance of the
 * very same state, with different chunk coordinates.
